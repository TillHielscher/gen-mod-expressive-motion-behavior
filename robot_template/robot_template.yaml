# A free-text description of the robot's physical capabilities.
# The LLM planner uses this to understand what motions are feasible.
capabilities: |
  Describe your robot's body parts and what they can do.
  Example: "Arms: Two 7-DOF arms capable of gestures and manipulation."

# Motion primitives available to the planner.
# Keys are descriptive identifiers; values explain the motion.
# Each key must have a matching DMP file in robot_{name}_primitives/.
primitive_lib:
  example_wave: "Wave one arm as a greeting gesture."
  example_idle: "Neutral resting pose with minimal motion."

# Primitives used when the timeline has no planned motion.
# At least one entry is required.
idle_lib:
  - example_idle

# Parameter ranges map the LLM's abstract animation-principle ratings
# to concrete robot-specific DMP modulation values.
#
# Required keys: Anticipation, Follow_Through, Arcs, Timing, Exaggeration.
# Each needs a min and max that define the robot's comfortable range.
#
# Follow_Through_Data (kinematic chain relations) is auto-computed from the
# URDF on first load and written back to this file.  You may also provide it
# manually; if the key is already present, auto-computation is skipped.
parameter_ranges:
  Anticipation:
    min: 0.0

  Follow_Through:

  # Follow_Through_Data is auto-computed from the URDF on first load.
  # To override, uncomment and fill in manually:
  # Follow_Through_Data:
  #   relation1:
  #     target: joint_2          # Joint that follows
  #     source: joint_1          # Joint that drives the follow-through
  #     inverse: false           # Invert the follow direction
  #     condition: joint_3       # Gate joint (or "None")
  #     lower_limit: -1.0        # Condition active range lower bound
  #     upper_limit: 1.0         # Condition active range upper bound
