capabilities: |
  Arms: The robot has two arms that can be used for gestures and interactions.
  Head: The robot has a head that can turn and tilt.
  Torso: The robot that can lean as part of given gestures.
  All individual movement that the robot can to return to its default pose before a new movement is started.
  Generally the robot needs to take particular care when choosing directions and angles for its movements aligned with the context. When something happens towards the one direction it move towards that direction aswell. MAKE SURE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHETHER THE CONTEXT IS ABOUT LEFT OR RIGHT!
